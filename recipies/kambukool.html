    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Kambu Koozh is a very common breakfast in rural parts of Tamil Nadu
      especially during summer months. Kambu koozh is also known as pearl millet
      porridge, kambu kool, is consumed widely in South of India due to its
      cooling health benefits. I have shared porridge or koozh made with whole
      pearl millet and check my instant bajra porridge made with pearl millet
      flour. 
      
      This is one of the traditional recipe and such a healthy recipe for
      you. It is such a hot hot summer here, this koozh just cools you
      instantly. I have an instant version of kambu koozh made with pearl millet
      powder.
